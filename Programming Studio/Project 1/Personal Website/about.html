              <p>Howdy, my name is Esha Adhawade and I am a computer engineering student at Texas A&M. Because of all my experiences and the people I have met, I gained a new perspective on this field, and chose to pursue a degree in it. However, lets start from the very beginning, back in the year 2000, when I was born in Michigan. My curiosity and circumstances led me to learn a lot about the world around me. My family and I moved a lot, so after living in the east coast for a very small time period, I spent most of my childhood in California, where my younger brother was born. In California, I moved to a new school almost every 2 years, and while it did get hard from time to time, I did learn a lot about dealing with situations, learning from others, etc. In high school, my family made a sudden decision to move to Texas. Despite being unhappy about it at first, I have grown to love this place, as I have spent some of my most crucial years here. From high school to my junior year of college, I have developed so much about myself, whether thats socially, academically, or physically. Texas has been the place of some of my most formative years. </p>

              <p>Dance: Starting with Indian Classical Dance, at the age of 4, I began to be strongly rooted in culture, grace, and expression. Kathak taught me a lot about storytelling through performance and the history of the dance form itself. However, dancing did not become a passion until high school. In high school, I joined SoReal, which is a hip-hop dance company in Houston. Here I developed a sense of community in a rather diversified environment. This is where I learned a lot about hard work, dedication, and the importance of a strong community. I had always dreamt of being able to perform at World of Dance, and after countless hours of practice and learning from my peers and instructors, our team was not only able to perform in such platforms multiple times but also take home first place. Below is a link to one of our performances, and personally my first competition with SoReal ever, which is most important to me because it is a good reminder that hard work pays off and shows me how much I have grown in dance and as a person since then.</p>

              <p>Makeup: Makeup was a very prominent part of being a performer, so I grew up being able to play with little eyeshadow palettes and lip glosses found in Claires. However, over time I found a passion for it and gained a new perspective on it when I started learning it as an art and the meaning it holds for several girls. Makeup oftentimes makes girls feel empowered or it can even be a stress reliever to many. This led me to start xyrabeauty, where I get the opportunity to practice this art and share it with others. Xyrabeauty has become a platform to be able to appreciate the art of makeup and the stories individuals attempt to portray through makeup. The link below is the Sephora community page where I was able to feature some popular products and share them with millions of individuals who are already part of the community. </p>

              <p>In Spring of 2019, I graduated from Tompkins High School with honors, and in Fall of 2019 joined Texas A&M University as a Computer Engineering major. By my sophomore year, I decided to pursue a minor in Economics. I am currently a junior here, and have participated in multiple research projects and received  multiple academic excellence awards,  that continue to define my love for engineering. It only comes to show how all aspects of engineering are important in the world we live in today, and in order to improve communities in the future. Engineering plays a huge role in factors such as communication, infrastructure, and even something as simple as our groceries. I am personally excited to see what more I can learn and participate in, within this industry.</p>
