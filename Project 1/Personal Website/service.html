              <p>I am the co-founder of Feeding Curiosity, which is a nonprofit organization. The goal of our organization is to bridge the educational divide around the world for underprivileged students with educational resources. I am privileged enough to be able to turn to teachers, books, peers, and the internet when questions arise, however, underprivileged children with the same passion to learn and discover are often limited by their circumstances. In the past 1.5 years, Feeding Curiosity has been able to hold multiple events and collect over $2500 worth of school supplies from over a hundred donors, and around $700 worth of clothes, shoes, and food for the less fortunate.

              <p> This semester, Fall 2021, I got the opportunity to become a Teaching Assistant for Engineering 217 labs. I teach 4 sections each week, and enjoy being able to provide a hands on learning experience for over a hundred students. Some key responsibilities is making sure I have a full understanding of the labs and concepts, so I can deliver that information is the most effective way for every student. I also hold weekly office hours to help answer students questions about the labs or in class assignments. Lastly, I grade the labs and assignments as students turn them in. Being able to see first hand when a student understand concepts or achieve a successful lab they worked for is truly satisfying. </p>
