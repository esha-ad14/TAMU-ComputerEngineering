         <p> The goal of the project was to put together different components to create semi-smart trucks for a company. The company wanted all the information about their trucks in one place, so by implementing sensor technology on trucks, the end user could determine the conditions, location, and utilization of the trailers. Some of my responsibilities in the research was being able to get the Raspberry-pi working and sending MQTT data over LTE. I also had to make sure that the sensors could pick up on factors like tire pressure, temperature, and working lights of a trailer. After those two steps, we were able to integrate different parts, where, I then was able to send GPS data and sensor data to the cloud. Lastly, I attended Engineering Inc meetings to present ideas and to get resources for the completion of the project. </p>

         <p> I participated in aggie challenge in 2019, where the goal of the research project was to create low-cost motion capture system using smartphones to help resolve health care issues in low income countries. The successful parts of the project was determining the dimensions of the L bar at different camera angles and then successfully synchronizing the data between the two smartphones. We ended up placing third for the overall work and project idea, by the end of the semester. </p>

        <p>I participated in the TAMU data science competition in 2020 and 2021. In 2020, I built a prediction model for expected flight delays by airlines for the third quarter of 2019. In the report I was required to include the use of additional datasets and the thought process of the code. In 2021, I built prediction models to recognize where most of the money is spent during elections, and wrote a short report about the effectiveness of the model created. </p>

        <p>Data Science in Python: I took a self paced online course that went over various methods of analyzing large data sets. There were weekly assignments and a final project. In the final project, I had to analyze and model the data in order to predict the number of shares an article would get.</p>

My teams goal was to develop a prediction model to determine where most users were located. I also had the opportunity to attent Walmarts mini sessions where I could to learn about more libraries and how they are implemented at Walmart. </p>
