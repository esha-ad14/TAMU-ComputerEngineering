Minutes from Previous Meeting
Through a Zoom meeting we met briefly for 10 minutes. We started off by discussing how much the team members who were new to react had learned throughout the week and if they believed they would be able to help but the finishing touches on the prototype. They said theyâ€™d be ready and we moved on to the status of our two main components. For the front end, there were some difficulties setting up the navbar but things had been progressing smoothly. On the backend we had been able to interact with the api but had yet to put it into a component.
